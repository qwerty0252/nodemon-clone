# dee

This project is just me trying to replicate and publish an npm package.
This project is a basic implemention of nodemon. Hopefully I'll improve on it later.
🙂✌🏾

## Installation

For now the package hasn't been published on npm.
To install you can clone this repo, and enter the command in the root directory of the folder.

> npm install -g .

When the package is published on npm enter this command

> npm install -g dee

## Usage

To use this package enter the command

> dee [your node app]
