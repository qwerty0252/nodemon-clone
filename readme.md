#dee
This project is just me trying to replicate and publish an npm package. 
This project is a basic implemention of nodemon. Hopefully I'll improve on it later.

## Installation
In the root directory enter the command 
>npm install -g dee

## Usage
To use this package enter the command 
>dee [your node app]
